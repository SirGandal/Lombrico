# Lombrico

This is the project for part of the course of Software Platforms For Network Devices, part of the Computer Software Engineering Bachelor's Degree of the Polytechnic University of Milan for the academic year 2010/2011 developed by Sergio Andaloro and Gioele Antoci.

This is a web crawler to gather and parse all the papers in a conference reported by IEEE or ACM associations. The processed pages are then indexed and exported to a HTML page that respects the formatting rules imposed by DBLP standards. In order to prove the functionalities of our program we used a sample of 1000 web page for both IEEE and ACM standard page.

Note: The application has been developed in 2011 and likely it won't work with today's IEEE and ACM pages.
